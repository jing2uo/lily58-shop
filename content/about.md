## About

After years of daily coding and typing, I began to experience pain in my fingers, which led me to explore split keyboards.

I tested a number of models — including the Ergodone, Ergotravel, Redox, and Corne — before ultimately settling on the Lily58. Its size and key count proved to be the most practical for everyday use.

Later, I extended the Lily58 by adding **2.4G wireless functionality** and **Vial support**, powered by the **RP2040 microcontroller** with the large available memory capacity. With two CR2450 batteries, I was able to use it for roughly a year under my typical workload of about eight hours per day. I haven't precisely measured battery life, but you can estimate it based on this usage pattern.

I believe this customized Lily58 can help you work more comfortably and efficiently, just as it has for me.

**Happy hacking!**
