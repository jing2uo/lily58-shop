We value your privacy and aim to be transparent about what data is (and isn’t) collected when you use this site.

## Website

This site is built with **Hugo**, hosted on **GitHub** and served through **Cloudflare Pages**.
From a technical perspective, no additional tracking or analytics have been added by us.
The site’s source code is open and publicly available: [GitHub (lily58-shop)](https://github.com/jing2uo/lily58-shop)

Because the domain is managed by **Cloudflare**, it may automatically log basic visitor information such as **IP address, region, and browser type** in the course of providing its services.

## Payments

Payments are processed securely through **Stripe**.
Stripe may collect and store certain payment-related details as required to complete your purchase.
We do not store your payment information ourselves.

## Orders & Shipping

The only personal information we actively use is your **shipping address**, which is required in order to deliver your keyboard.
We do not sell, share, or use this information for any other purpose.
